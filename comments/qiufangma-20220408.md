Hi, all

I support the adoption of this draft which I believe provides a good starting point.

The following are some comments, apologizes if Iâ€™ve missed something.

1. I still don't see any statistics related to R2 and R4 defined in Sec4.2. IMO it is important to record statistics related to server failures.
2. The following performance statistics of the alto server may be considered, or just clarified to be out of scope:
    - Total number of queries received
    - Total number of successful/error responses
    - Number of queries processed per second
    - Average response time
    - Usage of system resources such as CPU, memory, and storage
    - Connection statistics
3. Should HTTP-server related configuration be in our scope(e.g., cache-control, Retry-After)?
