Hi,

I looked at revision -07

This is a really big document and would probably benefit from a more
detailed review than I was able to give it. But it looks fine and ready to
progress to me.

A couple of nits.

Section 4.3 might usefully describe that this is an additional requirement.

You might reference draft-ietf-netmod-rfc6991-bis instead of RFC6991. You'll
be behind it in the queue, so you can safely use it as a normative
reference. That'll be a bit more future-proof.

Cheers,
Adrian
