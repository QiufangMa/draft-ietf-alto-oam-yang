Thanks for catching the inconsistent words. We will go through the whole
document and fix them.

Maybe the "report" label is confusing. We want to label "report" on all
four arrows from server manager and information resource manager to
performance monitor and logging & fault manager. We will refine Figure 1 to
make it clear.

Not sure which components are missing here. Algorithm plugins or ALTO
information resources?

Although I don't understand why it cannot work, I agree that it is a good
idea to move it to a different mode.

R3 focuses on the writable data nodes. R6 and R7 focus on the read-only
data nodes.

Management ("M" in "O&M") is not limited to server-level management and
configuration management. RFC 6291 has more concrete descriptions of this
term. For ALTO, RFC 7285 (Sec 16) suggests 6 pieces of management
components. The server-level management in this document defines an
aggregation of multiple management components. I guess this makes you
confused. We will add a paragraph at the beginning of Sec 5.3 to clarify
this.

Many thanks for the editing suggestions. We will consider them.

That's a very good point. The operation of server shutdown is not in the
scope. But the server crash should be considered. Right now, the data model
does not include any healthcheck-related data nodes explicitly. The syslog
may be used to handle this.
