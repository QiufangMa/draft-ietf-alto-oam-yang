Hi all,

My apologies for answering late to this WGLC.

I do support the progress of this document.

I have some few comments:

  *   Figure 1: it is not clear the direction of the arrows, specially where "report" is written, probably missing some "+" symbol. Please, review and clarify if needed.
  *   Stats parameters of ALTO. There are some global stat values, but there is no reference for the time in which those values have been collected (the total time in which the ALTO server is being up and running). Note that for the "last-stats" the time reference is 5 min, but for the absolute stats there is no time reference.
  *   Question. Regarding the number of PIDs I understand it is possible to retrieve the total number of PIDs in ALTO. Not sure if it would be meaningful to have the number of PIDs for filtered maps. Not sure if this can be relevant, maybe yes.

Thanks so much and apologies again for the time taken in answering (IETF absorbed most of my time before and during IETF week).

Best regards

Luis
