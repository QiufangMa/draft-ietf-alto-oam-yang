# Terminology

## Tree Diagrams

A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in this
document. The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is defined in
{{RFC8340}}.

## Prefixes in Data Node Names

In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects are often
used without a prefix, as long as it is clear from the context in which YANG
module each name is defined. Otherwise, names are prefixed using the standard
prefix associated with the corresponding YANG module, as shown in [](#tbl-yang-prefixes).

|---
| Prefix | YANG module | Reference
|:-|:-|:-
| yang | ietf-yang-types | {{RFC6991}}
| inet | ietf-inet-types | {{RFC6991}}
{: #tbl-yang-prefixes title="Prefixes and corresponding YANG modules"}
