# Objectives

This section describes the design objectives for the YANG data model:

- The data model should provide intent-based interfaces for administrators to
  create, update and remove ALTO information resources.
  - The data model should be extensible for new ALTO information resources.
  - The data model should allow developers to augment new APIs for ALTO
    information resource generation.
- The data model should support access control at the information resource level.
- The data model should support configuration for communication between the
  administrated ALTO server and other ALTO servers.
- The data model should collect statistics information of the requests to each
  ALTO information resource.
