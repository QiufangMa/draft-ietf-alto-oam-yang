# Objectives

This section describes some of the design objectives for the model:

- The data model should include configuration parameters for administrators to
  create, update and remove of ALTO information resources.
- The data model should be extensible for new ALTO information resources.
- The data model should allow developers to augment new APIs for ALTO
  information resource generation.
- The data model should support access control at the information resource level.
- The data model should support configuration for communication between the
  administrated ALTO server and other ALTO servers.
